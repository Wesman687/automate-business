## Setting Up Log Monitoring

### 1. File-based Monitoring
The email logger writes to `logs/email.log` by default. You can:
- Set up log rotation (configured for 10MB files, 10 backups)
- Monitor with tools like `tail -f logs/email.log`
- Parse logs with tools like `grep`, `awk`, or log analysis tools

### 2. External Monitoring
You can configure additional handlers:
- **Webhook handler** - Send logs to external services
- **Database handler** - Store logs in database
- **Syslog handler** - Send to system logs
- **SMTP handler** - Email critical alerts

### 3. Log Analysis Examples

**Count email sends per day:**
```bash
grep "EMAIL_SEND_SUCCESS" logs/email.log | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" | wc -l
```

**Find failed email operations:**
```bash
grep "EMAIL.*FAILED\|EMAIL.*ERROR" logs/email.log
```

**Monitor specific account activity:**
```bash
grep "Account: Tech" logs/email.log
```

**Track API usage:**
```bash
grep "EMAIL_API" logs/email.log | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

## Integration with Your Monitoring System

To integrate with your existing monitoring:

1. **Add custom handler** to `email_logging_config.yaml`
2. **Parse log messages** using the structured format
3. **Set up alerts** for ERROR level messages
4. **Create dashboards** using log data
5. **Monitor trends** in email activity

The structured logging format makes it easy to:
- Track email delivery rates
- Monitor system performance
- Debug email issues
- Generate usage reports
- Set up automated alerts
